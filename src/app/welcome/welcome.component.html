        <h1>Why Elderly Care ? </h1>
        <p>Lacking a sense of purpose and belonging in the universe is something that is very common for a lot of people.</p>
        <p>Without a sense of purpose, our souls and vibrancy are weaker.</p>
        <p>Our souls are not as happy as theyâ€™d like to be.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Helping others also creates a sense of belonging and reduces isolation.</p>
        <p>We feel more in tune with humanity and the bigger picture. We realize that we can actually have a huge effect on the world, and that gives us more empathy and compassion.</p>
